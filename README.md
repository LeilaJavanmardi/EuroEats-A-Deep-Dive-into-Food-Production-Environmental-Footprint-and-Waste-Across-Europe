### EuroEats: A Deep Dive into Food Production Environmental Footprint and Waste Across Europe

#### Project Overview:
The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between food production, its environmental impact, and food waste in European countries. By analyzing various datasets, we seek to understand the primary sources of food waste, the environmental implications of food production, and how European countries contribute to these impacts.

#### Research Questions:
What are the primary sources of food waste in Europe? (e.g., household, retail, food service)<br>
What environmental impact is associated with food production in European countries? (e.g., land use, freshwater withdrawals, etc.)<br>
How do European countries contribute to the environmental impact mentioned above?<br>

#### Dataset Information:
We have utilized datasets sourced from:<br>

World Food Production: This dataset contains information on food production worldwide. It consists of 11,912 rows and 24 columns, providing a comprehensive overview of global food production trends.
Environmental Impact of Food Production: This dataset comprises 43 rows and 23 columns, offering insights into the environmental consequences of food production activities.
Food Waste in EU: With 214 rows and 12 columns, this dataset provides data specifically related to food waste within European Union countries.
#### Project Goals:

Our primary objectives include:

Analyzing energy, water, and land usage in the food production industry.
Assessing the environmental impacts associated with food production.
Identifying the sources and extent of food waste in European countries.
Understanding how European countries contribute to environmental degradation through food production and waste.
Additional Information:
In order to achieve our goals, we have searched for complementary datasets to supplement the aforementioned ones. These datasets will provide further insights and enrich our analysis.
